This is documentation for various Roblox APIs under the `apis.roblox.com` domain. I intentionally have excluded anything that is documented under the Open Cloud API, since it's a bit redundant.

This was mostly made for myself because it's easy to forget endpoints and Roblox is slowly migrating old documented endpoints to the new API.

You can view the Swagger documentation here: https://ayuka.github.io/roblox-apis/

I can't guarantee all information here is correct, but I've tried my best to be accurate. Some of these things are annoyingly confusing.

PRs and issues are welcome. Hopefully this helps anyone interested in these APIs.

I am unaffiliated with Roblox and just did this for fun (I have weird concept of fun)
